## Foodie: A Super Original App
Mod 1 Final Project

## INSTALL
In order to run this app, first clone down this repo to your local machine. Next, run 'bundle install' in your terminal, then you need to create a database and populate it with some seed data. You can do this by running rake db:migrate and then rake db:seed in your terminal.

## DESCRIPTION
Okay, you've got our gems and you've got our code. Now, let's get started. FOODIE is an app where you (a user) can post about food you LOVE (or HATE), write a description and rate what you ate. A user can also look up what/where to eat. When a user creates their profile, they save information like "Fav Food", which they can search by in this app to find restaurants that serve that item. There are many ways to search, you'll have to download the app to find out the rest!

## INSTRUCTIONS
1. In your command line, run 'ruby ./bin/run.rb'.
2. Now you're on the home page. You can navigate the app with the arrow keys and select a field by hitting enter. Either sign in if you have an account, or feel free to create yourself an account.
  - IF you're creating an account, answer some questions and Foodie will store your info in Foodie's database. Next time you use Foodie, just log in with your name.
  - IF you've got an account, sign in with your name... Foodie's database has your info!
3. Ok... now we're in! You're seeing the main menu. You've got two options. You can either create a new post (maybe you ate something awesome and want everyone to know) OR you can just search Foodie for suggestions on what/where to get lunch today.
  - IF you're creating a new post, just answer some questions and your post will be saved!
  - IF you're searching Foodie, there's a lot you can search for. Navigate the search menu with the arrow keys to search for whatever you're in the mood for.
4. Once you've finished a post or a search, you'll have the option to either continue back to the main menu, or just exit. Make your selection and enjoy!
