## Foodie: A Super Original App
Mod 1 Final Project

## INSTALL
In order to run this app, first clone down this repo to your local machine. Next, run 'bundle install' in your terminal.

## DESCRIPTION
Okay, you've got our gems and you've got our code. Now, let's get started. FOODIE is an app where you (a user) can post about food you LOVE (or HATE), write a description and rate what you ate. A user can also look up what/where to eat. When a user creates their profile, they save information like "Fav Food", which they can search by in this app to find restaurants that serve that item. There are many ways to search, you'll have to download the app to find out the rest!

## INSTRUCTIONS
1. In your command line, run 'ruby ./bin/run.rb'.
2. Now you're on the home page. You can navigate the app with the arrow keys and select a field by hitting enter. Either sign in if you have an account, or feel free to create yourself an account.
  - IF you're creating an account, answer some questions and Foodie will store your info in your profile.
  - IF you've got an account, sign in... Foodie has your info!
3. Ok... now we're in! You're seeing the main menu. You've got two options. You can either create a new post (maybe you ate something awesome and want everyone to know) OR you can just search Foodie for suggestions on what/where to get lunch today.
  - IF you're creating a new post, move to step 4
  - IF you're searching, move to step 5
4. To create a post, just answer some questions and your post will be saved!
5. If you're searching the app, there's a lot you can search for. Navigate the search menu with the arrow keys to search for whatever you're in the mood for.
6. Once you've finished a post or a search, you'll have the option to either continue back to the main menu, or just exit. Make your selection and enjoy!
